Today we Started our project
* Worked on setting up the REPO
* Added the wireframe
* Setting up the MongoDB
* Fixing the GitLab restrictions

As a group we all worked on setting up the repo with Git and adding the
documents/journal files we needed for our project.

Later James and I worked on getting the MongoDB set up in our project and
getting the docker-compose up to what we needed.
