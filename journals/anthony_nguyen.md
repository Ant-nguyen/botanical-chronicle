Today we finished the backend-auth
and started working on the back-end end point for the CRUD of plants
We still need to limit access to some of the points but it is good overall.
Our AHA moment is that we figured out why we were getting a 401 error, it was because our accounts query was looking for emails by default but we use usernames. He had to get Riley to help us on that.
Looking forward to hopefully completeting the back-end tomorrow.

Today we worked on the back end auth
I took the driver seat today and we all worked together as a group mob programming style.
We primarily followed some of Riley's notes and lecture to parse an figured out how it worked.
I felt this was a good opprotunity to learn more about rapid API and get more experience with it
which was nice. It was also great working with Mongo and getting more experience with the database.

Today we Started our project
* Worked on setting up the REPO
* Added the wireframe
* Setting up the MongoDB

As a group we all worked on setting up the repo with Git and adding the
documents/journal files we needed for our project.

Later James and I worked on getting the MongoDB set up in our project and
getting the docker-compose up to what we needed.
