 - We finished the MVP Today!!! And touched up a few features. We also finished our unit testing for each person. Next, we will discuss the stretch goals we think will be possible while balancing our study time. I have also been nominated to be the presenter of our project so I will be practicing that on the side along with navigating the code properly in order to answer any questions efficiently.

## March 13th, 2024
- Today Chris is the driver and we are making the Log detail Page and the Edit Log Detail Page. We managed to knock out a stretch goal just while doing one of the forms for the date input which was pretty awesome. Our MVP is almost done so we are shooting for a tomorrow finish and do the unit testing and then discuss stretch goals.

## March 12th, 2024
- Lyle drove today and made the plant detail and plant log page have the features needed. We had a couple of issues with the page not redirecting immediately after a button was clicked but we got it resolved. At the end of the day, we made the issue for tomorrow and made another issue for our individual unit testing that we all need to do for our grade.

## March 11th, 2024
- Anthony drove today and we did a lot of code. We started the plant detail and log page and worked on getting the nav bar and links all connected. We also made all the basic html for the pages and completed the basic layout. We will finish the rest of the issue the next day.

## March 8th, 2024
- I drove today and we finished up everything with the backend and everything up to date with our wireframe to the Garden part of our wireframe. We completed our issues and made new issues for the next week which we plan on being done with the Log detail, detail, edit log, and edit plant form.

## March 7th, 2024
- Chris Drove today while we mob programmed and we made a lot of fine tunes to the code we already had set up.

## March 6th, 2024
- Lyle Drove today and finished up the plant form and we made the cards using bootstrap for the garden. Today was a lot of watching videos again and discussing the future code we will need to do.

## March 5th, 2024
- Anthony drove today and we made a lot of progress on the Garden home page and made all the buttons redirect back to the home. We also made the beginning of the plant form.

## March 4th, 2024
- I drove today and while the group mob programmed. We made final touches to any backend issues and went over the wireframe. We made the Garden basic set up and watched Riley's videos again to get a good jump start on the code we will need to have done this week.

## March 1st, 2024
- We mob programmed today, Chris drove this time. We were working on the plant log models and endpoints for the backend. We watched a lot of the videos Riley had for the Fast APIs for the backend. We are ahead of schedule and glad we have some videos to reference.

## February 29, 2024
Mob programmed today. Lyle drove today. Brought an issue to Riley today with a bug we were having with the backend auth. The issue was that the new username was being populated by the email field, so that when the email and username were identical in account creation the account creation would give a successful 200 message. So it was username=info.email instead of username=info.username here. We were mostly taking the code from the lecture line for line and imagine Riley fixed that at some point but we just missed it as we were coding through.

form = AccountForm(username=info.username, password=info.password)

## February 28, 2024
Today, my group mob programmed backend auth. Anthony drove.

We had an issue where the create user in mongo express was giving an unauthorized error that might have had something to do with token generation. After implementing the token, the bug went away.

## February 27, 2024
Today, my group mob "programmed" setting up the gitlab repo and adding wireframe to docs. I added extensions needed for vscode formatting. Watched (and advised) Anthony and I made merge requests for features to main. Walked through template for issue ticket.
