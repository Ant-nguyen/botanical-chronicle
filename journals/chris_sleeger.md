Today, my group mob "programmed" setting up the gitlab repo and adding wire frame to docs. I added extensions needed for vscode formatting. Watched (and advised) James and Anthony make merge requests for features to main. Walked through template for issue ticket.

Feel a lot more comfortable making changes in gitlab, but will be nice to get some hands on keyboard experience actually making a merge to main for some feature.

Today, my group mob programmed backend auth. Anthony drove.

We had an issue where the create user in mongo express was giving an unauthorized error that might have had something to do with token generation. After implementing the token, the bug went away.
